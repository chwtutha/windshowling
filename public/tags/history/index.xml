      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I kept a daily log of snippets from the news. Below is the result: more than 500 total entries, a mixture of U.S. news, global events and a few items of local or personal interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a comprehensive list of everything that happened. It&amp;rsquo;s more like a personal log of events that I thought were important enough to write down. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I saw happening in the news, in the order that it happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/everything-2025/2025-word-cloud.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;amp;lsquo;A word cloud of my 2025 news log.&amp;amp;rsquo;&#34; style=&#34;max-width: min(100%, 100%);&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;01-01 AP: A U.S. Army veteran driving a pickup truck that bore the flag of the Islamic State group wrought carnage on New Orleans’ raucous New Year’s celebration, killing 15 people as he steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;01-06 BBC: Under growing pressure from his own party, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he will step down and end his nine-year stretch as leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;01-07 AP: President-elect Donald Trump told residents of Greenland that “we’re going to treat you well” as his oldest son visited the mineral-rich Danish territory that’s home to a large U.S. military base, heightening speculation that the incoming U.S. administration could seek to acquire it. The president-elect later told a news conference he wouldn’t rule out using military force or economic coercion to take control of Greenland, saying that “we need it for national security.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;01-15 NPR: Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on a multiphase ceasefire that commits them to end the war in Gaza, President Biden and Qatar&amp;rsquo;s prime minister announced separately on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;01-15 NBC: Nicotine levels in cigarettes sold in the U.S. would have to be drastically lowered under a proposal released Wednesday by the Food and Drug Administration. If finalized, the change would mean that cigarettes would lose their ability to hook most people into addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;01-15 AP: U.S. regulators on Wednesday banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation’s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;The Russian Revolution: A New History&#34; by Sean McMeekin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading &amp;ldquo;The Russian Revolution: A New History&amp;rdquo; by Sean McMeekin (2017). This was my first time reading a full book on the Russian Revolution; until now I&amp;rsquo;d been relying on a working knowledge gleaned from Twitter threads, YouTube videos, and things that were mainly about other topics. But when a friend mentioned they were reading this book and learning a lot, I took it as my signal to finally go in depth. I listened to the audiobook over the course of 11 days in November, mostly while going on walks and doing chores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/russian-revolution-mcmeekin/russian-revolution-a-new-history-sean-mcmeekin-title-page.webp&#34; alt=&#34;The title page of &amp;amp;lsquo;The Russian Revolution: A New History&amp;amp;rsquo; by Sean McMeekin.&#34; style=&#34;max-width: min(100%, 100%);&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
