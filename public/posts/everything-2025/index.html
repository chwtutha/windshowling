01-01 AP: A U.S. Army veteran driving a pickup truck that bore the flag of the Islamic State group wrought carnage on New Orleans’ raucous New Year’s celebration, killing 15 people as he steered around a police blockade and slammed into revelers before being shot dead by police.
01-06 BBC: Under growing pressure from his own party, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he will step down and end his nine-year stretch as leader.
01-07 AP: President-elect Donald Trump told residents of Greenland that “we’re going to treat you well” as his oldest son visited the mineral-rich Danish territory that’s home to a large U.S. military base, heightening speculation that the incoming U.S. administration could seek to acquire it. The president-elect later told a news conference he wouldn’t rule out using military force or economic coercion to take control of Greenland, saying that “we need it for national security.”
01-15 NPR: Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on a multiphase ceasefire that commits them to end the war in Gaza, President Biden and Qatar&rsquo;s prime minister announced separately on Wednesday.
01-15 NBC: Nicotine levels in cigarettes sold in the U.S. would have to be drastically lowered under a proposal released Wednesday by the Food and Drug Administration. If finalized, the change would mean that cigarettes would lose their ability to hook most people into addiction.
01-15 AP: U.S. regulators on Wednesday banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation’s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk." />

<p>01-15 CNN: Farewell speech: President Joe Biden warned against threats of unchecked power and “tech industrial complex” in a farewell address from the Oval Office tonight. He also hailed his administration’s accomplishments. “It will take time to feel the full impact of what we’ve done together,” he said.</p>
<p>01-20 NYT: Donald John Trump completed an extraordinary return to power on Monday as he was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States and promised an immediate blitz of actions to begin drastically changing the course of the country and usher in a new “golden age of America.”</p>
<p>01-21 Guardian: Donald Trump’s much-vaunted but ill-defined new “Department of Government Efficiency” (Doge) program lost one of its leaders hours after the new president took office on Monday, as Vivek Ramaswamy bowed out of the government cost-cutting taskforce, leaving Elon Musk in sole charge.</p>
<p>01-26 BBC: The CIA on Saturday offered a new assessment on the origin of the Covid outbreak, saying the coronavirus is &ldquo;more likely&rdquo; to have leaked from a Chinese lab than to have come from animals. But the intelligence agency cautioned it had &ldquo;low confidence&rdquo; in this determination.</p>
<p>01-29 CNBC: There were no survivors after an American Airlines regional jet with 64 people aboard collided with a Black Hawk military helicopter moments before the airplane was set to land at Washington, D.C.&rsquo;s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night, officials said.

<p>01-29 CNN: Federal workers who don’t want to return to the office are being offered buyouts, according to a memo posted to the US Office of Personnel Management’s website Tuesday night.

<p>02-04 Reuters: President Donald Trump said the U.S. would take over the war-ravaged Gaza Strip and develop it economically after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere, actions that would shatter decades of U.S. policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

<p>03-16 ABC: The United States airstrikes that bombarded Yemen over the weekend targeted and &ldquo;took out&rdquo; multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday.</p>
<p>03-16 CNN: As President Donald Trump works to dramatically reshape the federal government, he is also in the middle of transforming another historic aspect of the presidency: the Oval Office. Nearly eight weeks since returning to office, Trump has tripled the number of paintings hanging on the office walls. Shelves and surfaces are adorned with flags, statues and ornaments. And in keeping with the style he has adhered to for decades, there is gold everywhere: new gold vermeil figurines on the mantle and medallions on the fireplace, gold eagles on the side tables, gilded Rococo mirrors on the doors, and, nestled in the pediments above the doorways, diminutive gold cherubs shipped in from Mar-a-Lago. Even the remote control for the television down the hall is wrapped in gilt.</p>
<p>03-19 NBC: Israel shattered its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes overnight Tuesday that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip — and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that “this is just the beginning.”</p>
<p>03-24 AP: Greenland’s people are bracing for another visit from U.S. President Donald Trump’s inner circle, with second lady Usha Vance set to travel to the autonomous Danish territory this week as her husband ratchets up talk about U.S. security and “territorial” interests in the vast Arctic island coveted by the administration.</p>
<p>03-24 “The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans”: The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg reveals that he was somehow invited by National Security Advisor Mike Waltz to join a Signal group chat where top Trump officials discussed details of plans to bomb Houthis in Yemen.</p>
<p>03-25 AP: Speaking to reporters traveling with him as he landed in Hawaii for his first trip to the Indo-Pacific as defense secretary, Pete Hegseth said &ldquo;nobody was texting war plans and that&rsquo;s all I have to say about that.&rdquo; Instead, Hegseth tried to discredit The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg — who was added to the Signal chat by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and reported on the texts — as &ldquo;peddling garbage.&rdquo; The National Security Council has said the text chain in Signal &ldquo;appears to be authentic.</p>
<p>03-26 Jeffrey Goldberg posts screenshots of Signal chat proving that war plans were openly discussed.</p>

<p>04-02 AP: Musk and his affiliated groups sunk $21 million into flipping the Wisconsin Supreme Court to conservative control, only to see his candidate defeated by 10 percentage points on Tuesday. The losing margin was four points larger than that of the only other Republican on the same statewide ballot, who was not tied to Musk’s money. The race was the first major test of the political impact of Musk.</p>
<p>04-02 ABC: President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled a long-promised, sweeping set of baseline tariffs on all trading partners and what he described as &ldquo;kind reciprocal&rdquo; tariffs on nations he claimed were the worst offenders in trade relations with the U.S. &ldquo;My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day,&rdquo; Trump said from the White House Rose Garden, claiming the action will free the U.S. from dependence on foreign goods. &ldquo;April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America&rsquo;s destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>04-04 NPR: Wall Street plummeted for a second straight day on Friday, as President Trump&rsquo;s tariffs escalated a global trade war and wiped out trillions of dollars in value from the U.S. stock market. The two-day selloff served as the financial community&rsquo;s most brutal warning yet about the potential fallout of Trump&rsquo;s trade policy. Investors, businesses, and consumers are all expressing mounting terror about how these sweeping new taxes could upend the global economy.</p>
<p>04-09 CNN: President Donald Trump announced a complete three-month pause on all the “reciprocal” tariffs that went into effect at midnight, with the exception of China, a stunning reversal from a president who had insisted historically high tariffs were here to stay.</p>

<p>04-21 Second Signal chat reported. NBC: “Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used his personal phone to send information about U.S. military operations in Yemen to a 13-person Signal group chat, including his wife and his brother, two sources with knowledge of the matter confirmed to NBC News.”</p>
<p>04-24 NPR: Tensions between South Asia&rsquo;s two nuclear-armed powers ratcheted up Thursday after India&rsquo;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to pursue &ldquo;to the ends of the earth&rdquo; those behind a militant attack on Tuesday … in which gunmen ambushed tourists in a scenic meadow in Pahalgam and killed 26 men, mostly Hindus. Eyewitnesses told Indian media that in some cases, the gunmen asked their victims if they were Muslims before killing them.</p>
<p>04-28 Politico: Mark Carney led Canada’s Liberal Party to victory Monday after a polarized and historic election dominated by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade policy. The rookie politician cemented the Liberals’ fourth-straight term in government, a rare feat in Canadian politics — while holding back the Conservative Party led by Pierre Poilievre, who lost his seat in the House.</p>
<p>05-02 NYT: Stocks on Friday erased losses suffered in the days after President Trump’s chaotic rollout of tariffs in early April, bolstered in part by a healthy report on the labor market.</p>
<p>05-06 Guardian: The US will halt its bombing campaign against Yemen’s Houthis after the Iran-aligned group agreed to stop targeting shipping in the Red Sea. “The Houthis have announced … that they don’t want to fight any more. They just don’t want to fight. And we will honor that, and we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated,” Trump said. He provided minimal details of the agreement and denied that he had struck a deal.</p>
<p>05-08 New pope elected: Leo XIV. Political narrative immediately forms. Past anti-Trump retweets dug up; Twitter full of repetitive “woke pope,” “American pope,” “Chicago pope” jokes</p>
<p>05-13 Axios: Joe Biden&rsquo;s physical deterioration was so severe in 2023 and 2024 that advisers privately discussed the possibility he&rsquo;d need to use a wheelchair if he won re-election, CNN&rsquo;s Jake Tapper and Axios&rsquo; Alex Thompson write in their new book, &ldquo;Original Sin,&rdquo; out May 20.</p>
<p>05-13 Trump to get ‘Palace in the Sky’ jet from Qatar and use it as Air Force One?</p>

<p>05-16 CNN: Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company on Friday said a “rogue employee” was behind its chatbot’s unsolicited rants about “white genocide” in South Africa earlier this week. The clarification comes less than 48 hours after Grok — the chatbot from Musk’s xAI that is available through his social media platform, X — began bombarding users with unfounded genocidal theories in response to queries about completely off-topic subjects.</p>
<p>05-18 CBS: Two people died and more than a dozen were hurt when a Mexican navy training ship hit the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

<p>05-21 Pentagon accepts Qatari jet.</p>
<p>05-22 AP: “Turn the lights down,” President Donald Trump said. It was showtime in the Oval Office.

But Trump wanted to talk about baseless allegations that white farmers in his country were being systematically singled out for persecution and murder.</p>
<p>05-22 Two staff members of the Israeli Embassy in Washington were shot and killed while leaving an event at a Jewish museum, and the suspect yelled, “Free, free Palestine,” after he was arrested.</p>

These top holders will enjoy a private VIP reception with Trump, and the four largest investors will also receive a limited edition Trump Tourbillon watch that sells for $100,000.”</p>
<p>05-28 Stimson: Following a terrorist attack on April 22, India launched punitive strikes on Pakistan on May 7. This began a four-day conflict between India and Pakistan from May 7-10, which became the most serious military crisis in decades between the two rival nuclear states. Both sides have declared victory amid considerable misinformation and disinformation about what occurred.</p>
<p>05-29 FBI leaders say jail video shows Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide; Kash Patel and Dan Bongino promise to release a surveillance video showing no one entered the cell before he was found dead.</p>
<p>05-30 NYT: As Elon Musk became one of Donald J. Trump’s closest allies last year, leading raucous rallies and donating about $275 million to help him win the presidency, he was also using drugs far more intensely than previously known, according to people familiar with his activities. He told people he was taking so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use. He took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms.

Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as unnecessary and &ldquo;inflaming tensions.&rdquo; Trump&rsquo;s move marks the first time since the 1960s that the federal government has activated National Guard troops without a governor&rsquo;s consent, a significant break from long-standing protocol.</p>

<p>06-15 NYT: Officials said that the night of Israel’s attack, senior military commanders did not shelter in safe houses and instead stayed in their own homes, a fateful decision. … Israel had taken out much of Iran’s defense capability, destroying radars and air defenses; crippled its access to its arsenal of ballistic missiles; and wiped out senior figures in the military chain of command. In addition, the aboveground part of a major nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz was severely damaged.</p>

Organizers of the &ldquo;No Kings&rdquo; demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering. Confrontations were isolated.</p>

<p>06-16 Economic Times: Israel has demonstrated tactical audacity by mounting bold attacks on Iran, but it may have misjudged Iran&rsquo;s depth, durability and capacity for calibrated retaliation. This has placed the region on a knife&rsquo;s edge as the conflict risks sliding into full-scale war, eventually drawing in the US as well as other actors.</p>
<p>06-16 The Verge: Trump Mobile is launching with a single plan called “The 47 Plan” for $47.45 per month, which it says offers the same coverage as the big three carriers. It will work with existing phones, but if you prefer, the company will also sell a $499 T1 Phone in a gold finish.”</p>
<p>06-16 NYT: President Trump has decided not to sign onto a statement calling for de-escalation between Iran and Israel that is being prepared by the Group of 7 industrialized nations, according to a White House official, the first evidence of an ongoing rift between Mr. Trump and his fellow leaders gathered for a summit in Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p>06-17 Trump suggests involvement in Iran war with use of ‘we’: “We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran. Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured “stuff.” Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA.” Later: “We know exactly where the so-called &ldquo;&ldquo;Supreme Leader&rdquo;&rdquo; is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don&rsquo;t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”&quot;</p>
<p>06-17 NYT: Iran has prepared missiles and other military equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East should the United States join Israel’s war against the country, according to American officials who have reviewed intelligence reports.</p>

<p>06-18 Al Jazeera: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear to United States President Donald Trump that a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict in May was achieved through talks between the two militaries and not US mediation, a top diplomat in New Delhi says. Trump had said last month that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to the ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.</p>
<p>06-18 NBC: National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, an outspoken critic of past U.S. military interventions abroad, appears to have fallen out of favor with President Donald Trump as he weighs military action against Iran, according to multiple senior administration officials with knowledge of the matter. Gabbard’s politically perilous position burst into the open this week when Trump brushed her back over her testimony to Congress in March. At that time, she said the U.S. intelligence community did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon — a comment at odds with Trump’s recent public statement about the threat posed by Iran’s potential nuclear program. “I don’t care what she said. I think they were very close to having one,” Trump told reporters Tuesday on Air Force One.</p>
<p>06-18 “We came to the conclusion we could not affirm there is any systematic effort in Iran at the moment to manufacture a nuclear weapon,&quot; says Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
<p>06-19 WSJ: “President Trump told senior aides late Tuesday that he approved of attack plans for Iran, but was holding off on giving the final order to see if Tehran will abandon its nuclear program, three people familiar with the deliberations said. Trump is hoping that threatening to join Israel’s strikes on Iran, which continued for a sixth day, will compel Tehran to meet his demands, the people said. He acknowledged that a U.S. attack was under consideration but said he still may decide against it.”</p>
<p>06-19 Senior U.S. officials are preparing for the possibility of a strike on Iran in the coming days, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. … Some of the people, according to Bloomberg, pointed to potential plans for a weekend strike. Speaking to reporters earlier on Wednesday outside the White House, Trump declined to say if he had made any decision on whether to join Israel&rsquo;s campaign. &ldquo;I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I&rsquo;m going to do,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>06-19 Trump will make a decision on whether the U.S. should get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran within the next two weeks, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Leavitt read aloud a message from Trump from the podium that said: &ldquo;Based on the fact that there&rsquo;s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>06-21 Atlantic predicts Trump will keep waffling on Iran: “Trump seems to recognize that he cannot unify the nation and therefore dares not lead it into any arduous or hazardous undertaking. That may be the secret self-awareness behind Trump’s “two weeks” hesitation. This is not a self-awareness that will help Israel or secure the United States’ long-term interest in depriving Iran of a nuclear weapon. But in the absence of any strategic planning or preparedness, that self-awareness is all we have to guide the country through the next fortnight and, very possibly, a long succession of “two weeks” after that.”</p>
<p>06-21 Trump: “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”</p>
<p>He continued: “Certain Iranian hardliner’s spoke bravely, but they didn’t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse! There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end. Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!”&quot;</p>

<p>06-22 NYP: Iran’s parliament has voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, the vital shipping channel through which around 20% of the world’s daily oil flows. The move, which could block $1 billion in oil shipments per day, is likely to send oil prices soaring. It will come into effect pending a final decision by Iran’s Supreme Council.</p>
<p>06-22 CNN: Vice President JD Vance, in his first public comments since President Donald Trump authorized US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, emphasized that the US is “not at war” with Iran as he laid out the president’s decision-making process. “We’re not at war with Iran. We’re at war with Iran’s nuclear program,” Vance said.</p>
<p>06-22 NYT: After several Trump cabinet members stressed no interest in regime change in Iran this morning, the president sounded more intrigued in a Truth Social post on Sunday afternoon: “It’s not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,’ but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!” he wrote.</p>
<p>06-23 Independent: Satellite pictures taken after the US military attempted to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities show significant damage to Tehran’s nuclear sites - but not necessarily to the extent claimed by Donald Trump.

<p>06-23 NYT: Iran fired missiles aimed at an American base in Qatar, the largest U.S. military installation in the Middle East, according to three Iranian officials with knowledge of the matter. Iran coordinated the attacks on the American air base in Qatar with Qatari officials and gave advanced notice that attacks were coming to minimize casualties, according to three Iranian officials familiar with the plans. Qatar said its air defenses had successfully intercepted the Iranian missiles.</p>
<p>06-23 Trump: “Did I hear Former President Medvedev, from Russia, casually throwing around the &ldquo;N word&rdquo; (Nuclear!), and saying that he and other Countries would supply Nuclear Warheads to Iran? Did he really say that or, is it just a figment of my imagination? If he did say that, and, if confirmed, please let me know, IMMEDIATELY. The &ldquo;N word&rdquo; should not be treated so casually.”</p>
<p>06-23 Trump: “I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same! … Congratulations world, it&rsquo;s time for peace.”</p>

It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE … On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, “THE 12 DAY WAR.””</p>
<p>06-24 Reuters: Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday he had ordered the military to strike Tehran in response to what he said were missiles fired by Iran in a violation of the ceasefire announced hours earlier by U.S. President Donald Trump. Iran denied violating the ceasefire. The armed forces general staff denied that there had been any launch of missiles towards Israel in recent hours, Iran&rsquo;s Nour News reported.</p>
<p>06-24 Trump told reporters: &ldquo;They don’t know what the f*** they’re doing. We have to have Israel to calm down because they went on a mission this morning.’ Minutes before facing the press, Trump typed out in anger on Truth Social: ‘ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. ‘IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!’”</p>
<p>06-24 CNN: “The US military strikes on three of Iran’s nuclear facilities last weekend did not destroy the core components of the country’s nuclear program and likely only set it back by months, according to an early US intelligence assessment that was described by three people briefed on it. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement: “This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as ‘top secret’ but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.”</p>

<p>06-25 Guardian: Donald Trump and the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have admitted to some doubt over the scale of the damage inflicted on Iran’s nuclear sites. “The intelligence was very inconclusive,” Trump told journalists at a Nato summit in The Hague, introducing an element of uncertainty for the first time after several days of emphatic declarations that the destruction had been total. “The intelligence says we don’t know. It could’ve been very severe. That’s what the intelligence suggests.”</p>
<p>06-26 WaPo: The White House plans to limit classified intelligence sharing with Congress after leaks to the press of an early assessment undermined President Donald Trump’s claim that U.S. airstrikes obliterated Iranian nuclear facilities, a senior Trump administration official said, setting the stage for a contentious classified briefing before senators Thursday. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who testified in March that U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, will be notably absent.</p>
<p>06-26 FT: “Preliminary intelligence assessments provided to European governments indicate that Iran’s highly enriched uranium stockpile remains largely intact following US strikes on its main nuclear sites, two officials have said. … It had been distributed to various other locations, the assessments found.”</p>
<p>06-26 Regarding Iran’s uranium: Hegseth: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not aware of any intelligence that I&rsquo;ve reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be, moved or otherwise.&rdquo; Trump: “The cars and small trucks at the site were those of concrete workers trying to cover up the top of the shafts. Nothing was taken out of (the) facility.”&rdquo;</p>

<p>07-02 NYT: Paramount said late Tuesday that it has agreed to pay President Trump $16 million to settle his lawsuit over the editing of an interview on the CBS News program “60 Minutes,” an extraordinary concession to a sitting president by a major media organization. Many lawyers had dismissed Mr. Trump’s lawsuit as baseless and believed that CBS would have ultimately prevailed in court, in part because the network did not report anything factually inaccurate, and the First Amendment gives publishers wide leeway to determine how to present information. But Shari Redstone, the chair and controlling shareholder of Paramount, told her board that she favored exploring a settlement with Mr. Trump. Some executives at the company viewed the president’s lawsuit as a potential hurdle to completing a multibillion-dollar sale of the company to the Hollywood studio Skydance, which requires the Trump administration’s approval.</p>
<p>07-02 NYP: Hip-hop icon Sean Combs was stunningly acquitted Wednesday on federal charges of forcing his former lovers to live out his degrading sexual fantasies — but found guilty of lesser prostitution raps.

<p>07-04 WaPo: The tax and spending bill passed by Congress on Thursday will triple federal funding for immigrant detention centers, setting the stage for a rapid expansion of these facilities and adding to concerns about the treatment of the growing numbers of immigrant detainees. This is the most “funding we have seen for a border immigration agenda in the history of the country,” said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, who researches criminal justice and incarceration in her role as a senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. “We are seeing a wholesale expansion of ICE detention centers.”</p>

<p>07-14 AP: President Donald Trump on Monday threatened Russia with steep tariffs and announced a rejuvenated pipeline for American weapons to reach Ukraine, hardening his stance toward Moscow after months of frustration about unsuccessful negotiations for ending the war. Trump said he would implement “severe tariffs” unless a peace deal is reached within 50 days. He provided few details on how they would be implemented, but he described them as secondary tariffs, meaning they would target Russia’s trading partners in an effort to isolate Moscow in the global economy.</p>
<p>07-15 Axios: House Republicans on Monday night voted against attaching a Democratic amendment to landmark cryptocurrency legislation that would force the Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier wrote to operators of public airports on Monday that their compliance is needed to “catch those who seek to weaponize science” and will safeguard the atmosphere from “harmful chemicals and experiments.”</p>
<p>07-16 NPR: Israel on Wednesday conducted airstrikes in downtown Damascus, the Syrian capital. The strikes came amid ongoing tensions in southwest Syria, home to the minority Druze, whose community straddles the border between Israel-occupied Golan Heights and Syria. The Syrian military joined Bedouin militias in clashes against the Druze. Israel struck the Syrian military there on Monday and Tuesday in what they said was an effort to protect the Druze and keep the Syrian side of the border demilitarized.</p>

According to Department of Homeland Security figures, cited by NBC Los Angeles, the raids have led to the arrest of 2,792 undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>07-16 Trump: “The Radical Left Democrats have hit pay dirt, again! … Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this &ldquo;bullshit,&rdquo; hook, line, and sinker. They haven&rsquo;t learned their lesson, and probably never will, even after being conned by the Lunatic Left for 8 long years. … Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don&rsquo;t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don&rsquo;t want their support anymore! Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”</p>

<p>07-17 Scoop: WSJ publishes the contents of a 2003 letter to Epstein written by Trump for inclusion in a birthday album put together by Ghislaine Maxwell. &ldquo;The letter bearing Trump’s name, which was reviewed by the Journal, is bawdy—like others in the album. It contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly “Donald” below her waist, mimicking pubic hair. The letter concludes: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” In an interview with the Journal on Tuesday evening, Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the picture. “This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” he said. “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”&rdquo;</p>
<p>07-17 WaPo: The White House on Thursday said that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a mild but chronic illness related to his age — a rare admission from one of the nation’s oldest presidents who has long sought to project vigor. Trump has chronic venous insufficiency, the White House physician said in a memorandum, a condition in which the legs have trouble delivering blood back to the heart.</p>
<p>07-17 Variety: &ldquo;TV’s ongoing problems with late night have come for Stephen Colbert, with CBS announcing Thursday that it plans to end his “Late Show” after the next TV season, citing a “financial decision.”&rdquo; (This was seen by many as an unspoken handout to Trump in line with the Paramount settlement, possibly to help enable its Skydance merger.)</p>
<p>07-17 Politico: President Donald Trump said Thursday he would sue the Wall Street Journal and its owner over a new bombshell report about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to begin the process of unsealing grand jury testimony in the disgraced financier’s criminal case. “Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,” Trump said on social media, though it’s unclear that a judge would approve the request. “This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!” That post came less than an hour after the president responded to a report in the Journal alleging he had sent a racy birthday letter to Epstein. Trump said he had personally warned the Journal’s owner, Rupert Murdoch, and its editor in chief, Emma Tucker, that the letter was “fake” before the report was published, calling the story “false, malicious, and defamatory.””</p>
<p>07-17 Politico: Prominent figures in MAGA world rushed to Trump’s defense after the Journal published its story. “Forgive my language but this story is complete and utter bullshit,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X. “The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it.” “Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it? Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?” Vance added. Even Elon Musk, whose relationship with the president has recently appeared to sour, said the letter “really doesn’t sound like something Trump would say” and “sounds bogus.”</p>

<p>07-18 NYT: President Trump mounted a vigorous rebuttal on Thursday night to a report in The Wall Street Journal that he sent a birthday greeting with a sexually suggestive drawing to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. His alibi: “I don’t draw pictures,” he wrote on Truth Social. But a review of the president’s past reveals that, for years, Mr. Trump was a high-profile doodler — or at least suggested he was. In the early 2000s, he regularly donated drawings to charities in New York. The drawings, many of which appear to be done with a thick, black-marker and prominently feature his signature are not dissimilar to how The Journal describes the birthday note he sent Mr. Epstein.</p>

<p>07-21 NYP: Hunter Biden claimed in a new interview that his father’s disastrous performance in last year’s debate with Donald Trump was due in part to Ambien. “He flew around the world.

<p>07-25 NYT: “This spring, the F.B.I. and the Justice Department made an all-out push involving hundreds of employees to scour the Jeffrey Epstein files with a single goal in mind — find something, anything, that could be released to the public to satisfy the mounting clamor from the angry legions of President Trump’s supporters. But after devoting countless hours to the project, working at times around the clock searching databases, hard drives, network drives, cabinets, desks and closets, the bureau and the department finally acknowledged this month that they had little to show for their efforts. They came to realize, for instance, that there was no specific “client list,” which previous investigators had known years ago.”</p>
<p>07-25 Trump shifting focus to Clintons amid speculation he’s trying to get Maxwell to give dirt on Clintons: “They don’t talk about them, they talk about me,” the president said about the media and its coverage of Epstein. “I have nothing to do with the guy.” A moment later, President Trump claimed Clinton went to the convicted sex offender’s island 28 times; he said that deserves much more scrutiny than his relationship with Epstein. “I never went to the island,” the president added.</p>

Many are wondering how sustainable this is going to be for all the parties involved — be it the FBI director or attorney general.” Despite his frustration, Trump has been hesitant to make personnel changes, according to another person close to the president: “He does not want to create a bigger spectacle by firing anyone,” this person said.</p>

Investigators recovered three pieces of paper from Tamura’s wallet that included a request that his brain be studied for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the official said. The disease is associated with head injuries that can be diagnosed conclusively after an autopsy.</p>

MAID now accounts for about one in 20 deaths in Canada—more than Alzheimer’s and diabetes combined—surpassing countries where assisted dying has been legal for far longer.&rdquo;</p>

That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT&rdquo;</p>

<p>09-19 AP: Estonia summoned a Russian diplomat to protest after three Russian fighter aircraft entered its airspace without permission Friday and stayed there for 12 minutes, the Foreign Ministry said. It happened just over a week after NATO planes downed Russian drones over Poland and heightened fears that the war in Ukraine could spill over. Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said Russia violated Estonian airspace four times this year “but today’s incursion, involving three fighter aircraft entering our airspace, is unprecedentedly brazen.”</p>

<p>09-19 NYT: A federal judge in Florida on Friday threw out President Trump’s defamation suit against The New York Times four days after it was filed, calling the complaint “improper and impermissible” in its present form. The judge provided Mr. Trump’s lawyers with 28 days to file an amended complaint. The lawsuit, which asked for $15 billion in damages, accused The Times and four of its reporters, as well as the book publisher Penguin Random House, of disparaging Mr. Trump’s reputation as a successful businessman.</p>
<p>09-20 Express: Moscow is preparing a &ldquo;greyzone&rdquo; attack on Poland before Christmas, a senior Russian military official has revealed.

<p>09-20 NBC: The federal investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has yet to find a link between the alleged shooter, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, and left-wing groups on which President Donald Trump and his administration have pledged to crack down after the killing, three sources familiar with the probe told NBC News. “Every indication so far is that this was one guy who did one really bad thing because he found Kirk’s ideology personally offensive,” one said.</p>
<p>09-20 NBC: Disney is under siege from all sides. Within 48 hours of its decision to pull late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air indefinitely, the parent company of ABC has once again found itself at the center of a bitter political battle. The company now faces protests outside its studios, celebrities threatening to break ties and political pressure from Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>09-21 Variety: Jimmy Kimmel and Disney are working toward reaching a compromise that would allow “Jimmy Kimmel Live” to return to ABC. The veteran host’s business and legal representatives are deep in discussions with Disney and ABC leaders in the hopes of finding a path to a compromise that would allow for the return of “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” according to three people with knowledge of the situation.</p>
<p>09-21 NYT: President Trump called Charlie Kirk the “greatest evangelist for American liberty” during a memorial service for the slain political figure, joining a parade of speakers who hailed Mr. Kirk as a “martyr” and vowed to carry on his mission to implement an explicitly conservative Christian vision of the United States. The service mixed religious devotion with a raw battle cry intended to galvanize the political movement of the polarizing activist, who was assassinated less than two weeks ago. Mr. Trump capped an event that began with evangelical music and somber remembrances of Mr. Kirk and steadily progressed into a hard-line political event. The whiplash was most clear in the final two speakers: Minutes after Mr. Kirk’s widow, Erika, urged the crowd to love their enemies as her husband did, Mr. Trump said he could not agree. “I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them,” he said, adding “Sorry Erika.”</p>
<p>09-22 Hollywood Reporter: Jimmy Kimmel is getting back on the air. The ABC late-night host is returning to broadcast on Tuesday following a brief-but-monumental suspension that sparked a national debate over the Trump Administration&rsquo;s pressure tactics and the modern limits and consequences of free speech. &ldquo;Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,&rdquo; ABC parent The Walt Disney Company said in a statement Monday. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>09-22 BBC: Doctors in the US will soon be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever Tylenol to pregnant women, US President Donald Trump said, citing a disputed link between the drug and autism. Trump made the announcement on Monday in the Oval Office alongside Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. The US president claimed that taking paracetamol, the main ingredient in Tylenol, also known in the US as acetaminophen, &ldquo;is no good&rdquo; and that pregnant women should only take it in cases of extreme fever.</p>
<p>09-23 NBC: Mysterious drones that forced the closure of a major European airport were part of a &ldquo;serious attack,&rdquo; officials said Tuesday, hours after the latest unsettling incident over the continent&rsquo;s skies. Authorities did not immediately assign blame for the two to three large drones that shut Copenhagen Airport — Scandinavia&rsquo;s largest — Monday night. But police said a hybrid attack could not be ruled out, and Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called it “the most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date.”</p>
<p>09-23 NYP: A massive illegal electronic device network capable of crippling cell towers and jamming 911 calls across New York City was uncovered by the Secret Service — just as world leaders prepared to descend on Manhattan for the UN General Assembly, officials said Tuesday. Investigators discovered the trove of devices — including more than 300 co-located SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards – at multiple locations within 35 miles of the United Nations.</p>
<p>09-23 Trump gives a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. While opening his speech, Trump told the room that the teleprompter wasn&rsquo;t working, saying that whoever was operating it was &ldquo;in big trouble.” He scolded representatives for their countries&rsquo; immigration policies: “I’m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell.&rdquo; He described climate change as &ldquo;the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”</p>
<p>09-23 Trump on Truth Social: “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option. Why not? Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like “a paper tiger.” When the people living in Moscow, and all of the Great Cities, Towns, and Districts all throughout Russia, find out what is really going on with this War, the fact that it’s almost impossible for them to get Gasoline through the long lines that are being formed, and all of the other things that are taking place in their War Economy, where most of their money is being spent on fighting Ukraine, which has Great Spirit, and only getting better, Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.”</p>
<p>09-23 BBC: President Emmanuel Macron used a UN meeting to say that France will join the UK, Canada and Australia in formally recognising a Palestinian state. &ldquo;We can no longer wait,&rdquo; he said, adding that recognition is a necessary step to break the spiral of violence and secure peace.</p>

<p>09-24 A sniper died from a self-inflicted gunshot early Wednesday morning after he shot three ICE detainees at a Dallas ICE facility from a rooftop, according to law enforcement. Officials confirmed two of the ICE detainees have died. The third was rushed to a hospital in critical condition. Police sources say the sniper, identified as a white male, was armed with a rifle on a roof. He shot himself as agents approached him.</p>
<p>09-24 FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo of unspent bullets from the deadly Dallas ICE facility shooting to social media, providing new details about the attack. The evidence, which included unspent shell casings inscribed with the words &lsquo;ANTI ICE,&rsquo; indicates an &ldquo;ideological motive&rdquo; behind the attack, Patel said.</p>
<p>09-24 AP: Hundreds of federal employees who lost their jobs in Elon Musk’s cost-cutting blitz are being asked to return to work. The General Services Administration has given the employees — who managed government workspaces — until the end of the week to accept or decline reinstatement, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Those who accept must report for duty on Oct. 6 after what amounts to a seven-month paid vacation, during which time the GSA in some cases racked up high costs — passed along to taxpayers — to stay in dozens of properties whose leases it had slated for termination or were allowed to expire.</p>
<p>09-24 Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to be indicted on criminal charges in the coming days in federal court in Virginia, MSNBC reported Wednesday.

<p>09-25 Government shutdown looming; budget deadline is the end of this month.</p>
<p>09-25 Denmark is considering triggering Nato’s Article 4 after multiple drones were deployed on four of its airports. Justice minister Peter Hummelgaard described the incursions as a ‘hybrid attack’ intended to spread fear. Separately, minister of defence, Troels Lund Poulsen, said that no one has been found responsible for the incidents, but ‘it certainly doesn’t look like a coincidence, but looks systematic’. He told a press conference this morning: ‘Everything indicates that it is a professional actor.’</p>

<p>09-25 NBC: President Donald Trump has demanded an investigation into what he called a “triple sabotage” at the United Nations General Assembly, including his allegation that an escalator was deliberately halted while he and first lady Melania Trump were riding it. The U.N. says the escalator was likely stopped when a White House videographer accidentally triggered a safety mechanism.</p>
<p>09-26 AP: James Comey was charged Thursday with lying to Congress in a criminal case filed days after President Donald Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. The indictment makes Comey the first former senior government official involved in one of Trump’s chief grievances, the long-concluded investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, to face prosecution.</p>
<p>09-26 CNN: Senior Justice Department leaders are advocating for a charge against President Donald Trump’s former adviser-turned-critic John Bolton this week, according to two sources familiar with the investigation.

<p>09-27 WSJ: President Trump said he was directing the Pentagon to send troops to Portland, Ore., to protect federal facilities, escalating his push to deploy the military in U.S. cities. Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Saturday he was ordering Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use the military to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, which he said were “under siege from attack by antifa,” a loose network of antifascist protesters that Trump recently called a terror group.</p>
<p>09-28 AP: A gunman opened fire inside a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan during a Sunday service and set the building ablaze, killing at least four people and injuring eight others. Police shot and killed the suspect, authorities said. Hundreds of people were inside the church in Grand Blanc Township when a man rammed a four-door pickup with two American flags in the truck bed through the front door, then got out of the vehicle and started shooting, Police Chief William Renye told reporters. Investigators believe he “deliberately” set the building on fire, Renye said. The bodies of two of the victims were found as authorities searched the debris in the church, Renye said, emphasizing the search was continuing and that more victims could be found.</p>

<p>09-28 AP: A mass shooting that shattered the evening tranquility of a picturesque, seaside town in North Carolina was a “highly premeditated” attack that left three people dead and five injured, police said Sunday. The suspect who allegedly carried out the attack on a waterfront bar was in custody. Nigel Edge, 40, of Oak Island is accused of opening fire Saturday night from a boat into a crowd gathered at the American Fish Company in Southport, a historic port town about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Wilmington, Police Chief Todd Coring said. Authorities said Edge piloted a small boat close to shore, which was lined with bars and restaurants, stopped briefly and fired. He then sped away. Roughly half an hour after the shooting, a U.S. Coast Guard crew spotted a person matching the suspect’s description pulling a boat from the water at a public ramp on Oak Island. The person was detained and turned over to Southport police for questioning, officials said.</p>
<p>09-29 Both of the shootings today were committed by Iraq War veterans.</p>
<p>09-29 US Sun: NATO has ramped up its air defences after mysterious drones continue to menace military bases and airports across Europe.

<p>09-29 AP: President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday they’ve agreed to a plan to end the war in Gaza but it’s unclear whether Hamas will accept the terms. The plan has been presented to Hamas, which is reviewing it in ‘good faith’, an official told AP. Trump laid out a 20-point plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war and establishing a postwar Gaza governance. The plan does not require people to leave Gaza and calls for the war to end immediately if both sides accept it.</p>
<p>09-29 NYT: The former Marine accused of killing four people in a fiery attack on a Michigan church held a deep grudge against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to two lifelong friends and other people who knew him. The animosity, the friends said, stemmed from a breakup with a religious girlfriend over a decade ago and led the man to rant about the church at his best friend’s wedding, refer to it as the Antichrist and, just days before the attack, spew invective against Mormons to a canvassing politician.</p>
<p>09-30 AP: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth summoned hundreds of U.S. military officials to an in-person meeting Tuesday to announce directives for troops that include “gender-neutral” or “male-level” standards for physical fitness as well as an end to “woke” culture in the military. “The era of politically correct, overly sensitive don’t-hurt-anyone’s-feelings leadership ends right now at every level,” Hegseth said. Hegseth used the platform to slam physical fitness and grooming standards, environmental policies and transgender troops while touting the loosening of disciplinary rules and weakening hazing protections. Hegseth said military leaders should “do the honorable thing and resign” if they don’t like his new approach.</p>
<p>09-30 Bloomberg: President Donald Trump told top military brass that the US is fighting an “invasion from within,” as he used a highly unusual gathering of officers stationed around the world to deliver a largely political speech that highlighted border security and rooting out “woke” culture. “After spending trillions of dollars defending the borders of foreign countries, with your help, we’re defending the borders of our country,” Trump said on Tuesday at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia. “It’s the enemy from within, and we have to handle it before it gets out of control,” he added. “We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,” Trump said.</p>
<p>09-30 AP: A partisan standoff over health care and spending is threatening to trigger the first U.S. government shutdown in almost seven years, with Democrats and Republicans in Congress unable to find agreement even as thousands of federal workers stand to be furloughed or laid off. The government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday if the Senate does not pass a House measure that would extend federal funding for seven weeks while lawmakers finish their work on annual spending bills.</p>
<p>09-30 NBC: President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that his administration has reached a deal with Pfizer for it to voluntarily sell its drugs at lower prices to Medicaid patients. As part of the deal, Trump said, Pfizer will sell some of its drugs on a new “direct to consumer” website called “TrumpRx.” Trump said the website would be operated by the federal government, but offered few details about how the program would work.</p>
<p>10-01 AP: Plunged into a government shutdown, the U.S. is confronting a fresh cycle of uncertainty after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to strike an agreement to keep government programs and services running by Wednesday’s deadline. Roughly 750,000 federal workers are expected to be furloughed, some potentially fired by Trump’s Republican administration. Many offices will be shuttered, perhaps permanently, as Trump vows to “do things that are irreversible, that are bad” as retribution. His deportation agenda is expected to run full speed ahead, while education, environmental and other services sputter. The economic fallout is expected to ripple nationwide.</p>
<p>10-02 Fox: At least two victims have died and three others are in a serious condition after a car and knife attack outside a synagogue in Manchester in the United Kingdom, authorities said. The attack came on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar which ends later today. Police said they cannot currently confirm if the suspect is dead due to safety issues surrounding suspicious items on his person. The bomb disposal unit has been called and is now at the scene.</p>
<p>10-02 NYT: President Trump has decided that the United States is engaged in a formal “armed conflict” with drug cartels his team has labeled terrorist organizations and that suspected smugglers for such groups are “unlawful combatants,” the administration said in a confidential notice to Congress this week.</p>

<p>10-03 AP: President Donald Trump is openly embracing the conservative blueprint he desperately tried to distance himself from during the 2024 campaign, as one of its architects works to use the government shutdown to accelerate his goals of slashing the size of the federal workforce and punishing Democratic states. In a post on his Truth Social site Thursday morning, Trump announced he would be meeting with his budget chief, “Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.”</p>

<p>10-03 CNN: The US military carried out another strike on a boat operating in the Caribbean officials deemed to be a “narco-trafficking vessel” on Friday morning, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced in a social media post. The strike killed all four people who were on board, Hegseth said.</p>
<p>10-03 JPost: Hamas said that it would release all of the hostages in an effort to re-enter negotiations, in a Friday statement. Hamas officials later told international media that it would likely take longer than the 72 hours outlined in the US proposal to release them. Hamas gave mediators its response to US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s plan for ending the Gaza war earlier Friday evening and promised that it would approve transferring the power of the Gaza Strip over to a Palestinian governing body that would be elected &ldquo;based on Palestinian national consensus and with Arab and Islamic support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10-03 The Hill: Senate Democrats and Republicans on Friday failed to pass competing bills to fund the government, extending the shutdown into next week. The measures were expected to fail. Shortly after the failed votes, the House GOP said it would extend its recess through Oct. 13, a move to put pressure on Senate Democrats.</p>
<p>10-04 NYT: On Friday, responding to a new ultimatum from Mr. Trump, Hamas announced that it was ready to release all the hostages. But it said nothing about how soon it would do so, demurred on laying down its arms, and said it wanted to “discuss the details” of Mr. Trump’s plan. To Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Mr. Netanyahu’s, this was “in essence, a rejection by Hamas” of the president’s proposal, he wrote on social media. To Michael Herzog, Mr. Netanyahu’s former ambassador to the United States, it was “a ‘no’ cloaked as a ‘yes,’” he said in an interview. Yet Mr. Trump embraced the Hamas statement as an unqualified “yes.” “Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,” he wrote on social media. “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!”</p>
<p>10-05 Axios: When Hamas came back with a &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; to President Trump&rsquo;s Gaza peace proposal on Friday, Trump called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss what he saw as good news. Netanyahu felt differently. &ldquo;Bibi told Trump this is nothing to celebrate, and that it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; a U.S. official with knowledge of the call told Axios. Trump fired back: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re always so f***ing negative. This is a win. Take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10-06 NYP: President Trump is deploying 400 Texas National Guard troops to Illinois, Oregon, and other states as swarms of anti-ICE protesters continue to clash with federal agents, Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday night. The Illinois Democrat blasted Trump’s “invasion” hours after the president mobilized 300 California National Guard members to Portland, where unrest has raged for over 100 consecutive days outside an immigration detention center — a scene that has been playing out in Chicago since September.</p>
<p>10-06 NYT: With Mr. Trump and lawmakers having made no progress on a deal that would reopen the government, one thing was clear as the shutdown headed into its second workweek: There was little sense of urgency in Washington about cleaning up a mess that has thousands of federal workers facing furloughs and possible layoffs, and could disrupt critical federal programs. It all reflects the reality of two parties so convinced that they have the political advantage in their partisan battle that a shutdown has seemed inevitable for weeks, and a quick resolution feels out of reach.</p>
<p>10-06 Politico: President Donald Trump on Monday said he would consider using the Insurrection Act to deploy the military if federal courts prevented him from deploying the National Guard to protect federal buildings and conduct law enforcement operations. The comments came a day after a federal judge blocked the president from sending National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, which Trump claims has been taken over by left-wing “domestic terrorists.” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he did not yet see the need to use the Insurrection Act, but “if I had to enact it, I’d do it, if people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” “You look at what’s happening with Portland over the years, it’s a burning hell hole,” Trump added. “And then you have a judge that lost her way that tries to pretend that there’s no problem.”</p>
<p>10-08 NYP: A 29-year-old Biden-supporting Uber driver obsessed with dystopian imagery, “despair and bitterness” is charged with “maliciously” sparking the Palisades Fire, authorities said Wednesday — nine months after the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles history erupted. Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, is accused of setting a brush fire Jan. 1 that was put out, but then smoldered unnoticed underground for days before igniting the raging Palisades inferno, which left 12 people dead and caused about $150 billion in damages.</p>
<p>10-09 AFP: Thousands of jubilant Israelis gathered in a Tel Aviv square Thursday, hopeful for the return of hostages held in Gaza, after two years of fear and worry. Many wore stickers reading &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming back&rdquo;, waving Israeli and US flags and clutching photos of the hostages after Israel and Hamas reached a hostage release and truce deal in a major step towards ending the war.</p>
<p>10-09 NBC: New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat who has clashed with President Donald Trump, was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Virginia.10-10 AP: President Donald Trump was passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday despite jockeying from his fellow Republicans, various world leaders and — most vocally — himself. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee said it was honoring Machado “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” The White House responded bitterly to the news of the award Friday, with communications director Steven Cheung saying members of “the Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace” because they didn’t recognize Trump, especially after the Gaza ceasefire deal his administration helped strike this week.</p>
<p>10-10 CNBC: Stocks moved decidedly lower in a rapid move on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened higher tariffs on China, accusing the country of ‘becoming very hostile’ with its restrictions on rare earth metals, a key resource for the tech and defense industries. “I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so,” said Trump, in a post on Truth Social. “One of the policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America.”</p>
<p>10-10 CBS: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced a finalized agreement that will allow the Qatari Emiri Air Force to build a facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. There are no foreign military bases in the U.S., but some foreign militaries do maintain a presence for training.</p>
<p>10-12 Daily Mail: Hamas is set to release Israeli hostages from Gaza &lsquo;any moment now,&rsquo; US Vice President JD Vance announced Sunday morning. A temporary truce began on Friday, with the remaining 48 Israeli hostages set to be released on Monday following a 72-hour deadline. Israel believes 20 of them are alive.</p>
<p>10-12 AP: A mass shooting at a crowded bar on an idyllic South Carolina island has left four people dead and at least 20 injured, officials said. The shooting occurred early Sunday at Willie’s Bar and Grill on St. Helena Island, officials said. A large crowd was at the scene when sheriff’s deputies arrived and found several people suffering from gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>10-13 AP: Hamas released all 20 of the last living hostages on Monday, the Israeli military said. Buses carrying dozens of freed Palestinian prisoners drove to the West Bank city of Ramallah and the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Prisoners Office said. Israel has released more than 1,900 prisoners as part of the ceasefire deal. U.S. President Donald Trump is in the region to discuss the U.S.-proposed deal and postwar plans with other leaders. A surge of humanitarian aid was expected into famine-stricken Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless.</p>
<p>10-13 Slate: The Georgia congresswoman whom Democrats spent years portraying as the wild-eyed manifestation of the MAGA fringe is suddenly singing a new tune. Marjorie Taylor Greene has broken with her party and Trump on a number of high-profile occasions this year, calling the situation in Gaza a “genocide” and criticizing Trump’s bombing of Iran. In perhaps her most high-profile move, she was one of a few Republicans to sign the House discharge petition forcing a vote to release all the Epstein files. That, especially, is not going over well with the White House. As if the trend-piece sirens weren’t already blaring in newsrooms, Greene made another splash this week when she defended extending expiring Obamacare subsidies, the very issue over which Democrats are waging this shutdown.</p>
<p>10-14 NYT: President Trump will host Javier Milei, the leader of Argentina, at the White House on Tuesday, just days after the United States agreed to move ahead with a major bailout of the Latin American nation. The face-to-face meeting between the political allies comes after the Trump administration agreed to provide Argentina a $20 billion lifeline that would come in the form of a currency swap with the nation’s central bank, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The details of the bailout remain unclear, but it could provide a political boost for Mr. Milei, who is hoping to stave off a financial crisis and a political disaster for his party.</p>
<p>10-14 POLITICO publishes report on leaked Young Republicans group chat in which they “called Black people monkeys, repeatedly used slurs for gay, Black, Latino and Asian people, and jokingly celebrated Adolf Hitler.” Democrats condemn; JD Vance defends.</p>
<p>10-14 Telegraph: Hamas has carried out a mass execution in the streets of Gaza as part of a series of bloody reprisals following the withdrawal of Israeli forces from key urban areas. Footage has emerged appearing to show around eight kneeling, blindfolded men, bearing signs of beatings, being shot dead in front of a crowd.</p>
<p>10-14 Daily Beast: President Donald Trump complained in a late-night social media post that TIME magazine had published a photo of him that “may be the Worst of All Time” to accompany a fawning article about the Gaza ceasefire deal. The president acknowledged that the piece—which ran on the cover with the title “His Triumph”—was “a relatively good story about me,” but demanded to know why the magazine had run such a bad picture of his hair. “They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one,” Trump wrote at about 1:30 a.m. Washington time. “Really weird!” he continued. “I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”</p>

<p>10-15 CNN: At least one US military strike in the Caribbean over the last two months targeted Colombian nationals on a boat that had left from Colombia, according to two people briefed by the Pentagon about the strikes. The deliberate targeting of Colombians, which has not been previously reported, suggests that the US military’s campaign against suspected narcotics trafficking groups in the Caribbean is wider than previously believed. The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported.</p>
<p>10-15 Politico: Two more members of a Young Republican group chat strewn with racist epithets and hateful jokes stepped down from their jobs Tuesday after POLITICO published an exclusive report on the Telegram exchanges. Peter Giunta’s time working with New York Assemblymember Mike Reilly “has ended,” the Republican lawmaker said. Giunta served as chair of the New York State Young Republicans when the chat took place. Joseph Maligno, who previously identified himself as the general counsel for that group, is no longer an employee of the New York State Unified Court System, a courts spokesperson confirmed.</p>

<p>10-16 NYT: The military commander overseeing the Pentagon’s escalating attacks against boats in the Caribbean Sea that the Trump administration says are smuggling drugs said on Thursday that he was stepping down. The officer, Adm. Alvin Holsey, is leaving his job as head of the U.S. Southern Command, which oversees all operations in Central and South America, even as the Pentagon has rapidly built up some 10,000 forces in the region in what it says is a major counterdrug and counterterrorism mission. It was unclear why Admiral Holsey is suddenly departing, less than a year into what is typically a three-year job, and in the midst of the biggest operation in his 37-year career. But one current and one former U.S. official, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said that Admiral Holsey had raised concerns about the mission and the attacks on the alleged drug boats.</p>
<p>10-16 CNN: President Donald Trump on Thursday warned that if Hamas keeps killing people in Gaza, “we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” marking a sharp escalation of his rhetoric against the group as he tries to maintain a ceasefire in its conflict with Israel. The threat – just three days after the deal was signed in the Middle East – came amid reports that Hamas fighters have used the truce to quickly and violently reassert control over the Gaza Strip, targeting Palestinians who they deemed to have collaborated with Israeli forces during the war.</p>
<p>10-16 CNN: John Bolton, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser-turned-adversary, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland on Thursday.

<p>10-17 AP: The U.S. has seized survivors after a military strike Thursday on a suspected drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean, the first since President Donald Trump began launching deadly attacks in the region last month, a defense official and another person familiar with the matter said Friday. It is believed to be at least the sixth strike in the waters off Venezuela since early September, and the first to result in survivors who were picked up by the U.S. military. It was not immediately clear what would be done with the survivors, who the people said were being held on a U.S. Navy vessel.</p>

<p>10-17 NYT: President Trump on Friday commuted the sentence of former Representative George Santos, the disgraced Republican fabulist from New York who was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for financial fraud. In a social media post, Mr. Trump called Mr. Santos “somewhat of a ‘rogue’” but said that he believed that the former congressman’s sentence was excessive given the nature of his crime. The president also suggested he’d been moved by Mr. Santos’s accounts of being in solitary confinement, which he had published in a local Long Island newspaper. “George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media. “Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!”</p>
<p>10-18 NYT: The Marines plan to fire 155-millimeter artillery shells over a major freeway in Southern California on Saturday as part of a demonstration at Camp Pendleton to celebrate the Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary. The plans to fire over the freeway triggered outrage by Gov. Gavin Newsom late Friday night after his office had been informed days earlier that the celebration would not involve firing munitions across Interstate 5, a heavily traveled corridor between Los Angeles and San Diego. He criticized President Trump and said the lack of coordination among state, federal and local officials was creating a dangerous situation. The artillery demonstration, to be attended by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and military officials, will take place on the same day that anti-Trump activists plan to hold “No Kings” protests across the country, including in Southern California.</p>
<p>10-18 AP: Protesting the direction of the country under President Donald Trump, people gathered Saturday in the nation’s capital and communities across the U.S. for “ No Kings ” demonstrations — what the president’s Republican Party is calling “Hate America” rallies. This is the third mass mobilization since Trump’s return to the White House and comes against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only has closed federal programs and services, but is testing the core balance of power as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways that organizers warn are a slide toward American authoritarianism.</p>
<p>10-19 Telegraph: Three suspects are on the run after breaking into Paris’s Louvre museum and stealing pieces from Napoleon’s jewellery collection worth millions of pounds.

<p>10-19 NYT: President Gustavo Petro of Colombia accused the United States of murdering an innocent fisherman in an attack on a boat American authorities claimed was carrying illicit drugs, prompting President Trump to declare on Sunday that he would slash assistance to Colombia, one of Washington’s top aid recipients in Latin America.</p>
<p>10-20 FT: Donald Trump urged Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept Russia’s terms for ending its war in a volatile White House meeting on Friday, warning that Vladimir Putin had said he would “destroy” Ukraine if it did not agree. The meeting between the US and Ukrainian presidents descended many times into a “shouting match”, with Trump “cursing all the time”, people familiar with the matter said. They added that the US president tossed aside maps of the frontline in Ukraine, insisted Zelenskyy surrender the entire Donbas region to Putin, and repeatedly echoed talking points the Russian leader had made in their call a day earlier. Though Ukraine ultimately managed to swing Trump back to endorsing a freeze of the current front lines, the acrimonious meeting appeared to reflect the capricious nature of Trump’s position on the war and his willingness to endorse Putin’s maximalist demands.</p>
<p>10-20 Guardian: A live artillery shell exploded prematurely during a marines live-fire demonstration that launched over a southern California freeway in celebration of the military branch’s 250th anniversary, raining shrapnel down on a California Highway Patrol vehicle and a motorcycle that was part of JD Vance’s detail, according to a police report.</p>

According to our source, the President is &ldquo;vacillating&rdquo; on a commutation. We&rsquo;re told some of the W.H. staff are urging Trump not to commute the sentence.

<p>10-21 NYT: President Trump is demanding that the Justice Department pay him about $230 million in compensation for the federal investigations into him, according to people familiar with the matter, who added that any settlement might ultimately be approved by senior department officials who defended him or those in his orbit. The situation has no parallel in American history, as Mr. Trump, a presidential candidate, was pursued by federal law enforcement and eventually won the election, taking over the very government that must now review his claims. It is also the starkest example yet of potential ethical conflicts created by installing the president’s former lawyers atop the Justice Department.</p>
<p>10-22 President Trump’s plan to add an expansive ballroom to the White House will mean the demolition of the entire East Wing, which was expected to be fully torn down by this weekend, according to a senior administration official.</p>

In a statement released by Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, the socialist government said the arrests revealed what it described as a “false-flag operation” planned from waters bordering Trinidad and Tobago, or from Trinidadian or Venezuelan territory, “to generate a full-scale military confrontation” against Venezuela.</p>
<p>10-27 BBC: US President Donald Trump has not ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term for the White House, saying he would &ldquo;love to do it&rdquo;.

Speaking to reporters during his trip to Asia, Trump described the idea as &ldquo;too cute&rdquo; and said it &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be right&rdquo;.</p>

The directive comes after an incident in Rafah earlier today in which terrorists opened fire on IDF forces. At least one soldier was seriously wounded in the attack and evacuated for medical treatment. The escalation follows mounting tensions over the handling of hostages’ remains. Last night Hamas returned remains that Israel says were already buried, yet claimed they were a newly recovered body — fueling Israeli outrage and contributing to today’s security response.</p>

<p>10-30 AP: King Charles III on Thursday stripped his disgraced brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Buckingham Palace said. After the king’s rare move, which follows years of shameful scandals, he will be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and not as a prince, and he will have to vacate his Royal Lodge mansion near Windsor Castle. Demand had been growing on the palace to oust the prince from Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title Duke of York earlier this month over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir hit bookstores last week.</p>

<p>11-02 AP: A Michigan defense lawyer is disputing FBI Director Kash Patel’s allegations that his 20-year-old client and four other young suspects were planning to carry out a terror attack on Halloween weekend. The investigation involved discussion in an online chat room involving at least some of the suspects who were taken into custody, according to two people briefed on the investigation who could not publicly discuss details. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The group allegedly discussed carrying out an attack around Halloween, referring to “pumpkin day,” according to one of the people. The other person briefed on the investigation confirmed that there had been a “pumpkin” reference. However, lawyer Amir Makled, who represents a man from the suburb of Dearborn who was still detained on Saturday, said federal authorities haven’t given him many details about the investigation but after reviewing the matter, he concluded that no terror event was planned. He said he doesn’t expect any charges will be filed.</p>

Trump sat down with correspondent Norah O’Donnell for 90 minutes, but only about 28 minutes were broadcast. The edits are notable because, exactly one year before Trump was interviewed by O’Donnell at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday he had sued CBS over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which he alleged had been deceptively edited to help her chances in the presidential election. While many legal experts widely dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless” and unlikely to hold up under the first amendment, CBS settled with Trump for $16m in July.</p>

Trump has called the bill a “very big victory.”</p>
<p>11-12 AP: The U.S. ended production of the penny Wednesday, abandoning the 1-cent coins that were embedded in American culture for more than 230 years but became nearly worthless. When it was introduced in 1793, a penny could buy a biscuit, a candle or a piece of candy. Now most of them are cast aside to sit in jars or junk drawers, and each one costs nearly 4 cents to make. “God bless America, and we’re going to save the taxpayers $56 million,” Treasurer Brandon Beach said at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia before hitting a button to strike the final penny. The coins were then carefully placed on a tray for journalists to see. The last few pennies were to be auctioned off.</p>
<p>11-12 NYT: President Trump and his administration on Wednesday ramped up a pressure campaign on congressional Republicans who are pushing for a full release of the Justice Department’s files about the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, rushing to head off a House vote on the matter. But even as the White House made last-ditch moves to block action, proponents of a vote reached a critical threshold to force one, winning the final signature on a petition that will require the House to bring up the matter in the coming days. By Wednesday night, Speaker Mike Johnson, who has opposed considering the measure, said he would relent and bring it to a vote next week. It came the same day that top officials had summoned Representative Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican who has signed the petition, to a meeting in the White House Situation Room with Attorney General Pam Bondi and the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, to discuss her demand to release the files, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>

Dan Caine returned to the White House on Friday for a second consecutive day of deliberations centered on potential military action in Venezuela, as U.S. forces in the region prepared for possible attack orders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Also joining the White House meeting were Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, these people said.</p>

<p>11-16 AP: Several thousand people took to the streets of Mexico City on Saturday to protest crime, corruption and impunity in a demonstration organized by members of Generation Z, but which ended with strong backing from older supporters of opposition parties. The demonstration was mostly peaceful but ended with some young people clashing with the police.

By Monday, he was saying, “Sure,” he would sign the legislation he has spent months trying to kill.</p>

Despite months of calling the issue a “Democratic hoax,” the president has said he’ll sign the bill.</p>
<p>11-19 CNN: Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’s recent bout of volatility. So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday. The stock market rally — that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years.</p>

<p>11-20 Mediaite: President Donald Trump suggested that six Democratic lawmakers who put out a video urging military members to “refuse illegal orders” were guilty of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!’ in a stunning Thursday morning Truth Social post. “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll presented Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday with a version of the 28-point plan President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff recently drafted with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. That plan, which has been leaked in the press and confirmed by several officials, included several red lines for Ukraine, including a massive reduction of its army size and ceding territory to Russia that it has not yet conquered militarily.11-21 20:53:16 Georgia GOP Rep.

<p>11-21 Daily Mail: Usha Vance was spotted at an official engagement without her wedding ring, weeks after husband JD Vance publicly revealed the religious divide in their marriage. The image comes after weeks of nasty trolls whispering about the state of the Vance marriage, which began in October with the Vice President&rsquo;s tight hug he gave to Erika Kirk during a memorial for her husband, the right wing activist Charlie Kirk. The speculation about a possible rift between the Second Couple was fueled by the VP admitting that he has pleaded with his wife to convert from Hinduism: he is a Roman Catholic.</p>
<p>11-22 WSJ: Gunmen stormed a Catholic school in Nigeria, abducting more than 300 students and teachers at a time when President Trump is threatening military action to protect Christians in the West African nation.

Right now, details are limited, but 7 News Detroit has confirmed that one person was shot in the abdomen. Clinton Township police say the victim is stable. Police say the person of interest in the shooting is described as a Black male wearing a green hooded sweatshirt with white flowers, jeans and tennis shoes. They were last seen leaving the mall to the west, police say. According to police, the incident appears to be isolated, not targeted at the tree lighting ceremony, and occurred between two groups.</p>
<p>11-23 A rival European plan to end the war in Ukraine, obtained by The Telegraph, differs sharply from the contentious 28-point proposal put forward by the Trump administration. The US proposals have been widely criticised as being too favourable to Moscow, ceding large tracts of territory to Russia, reducing the size of the Ukrainian army and barring Nato troops from Ukrainian soil. In contrast, the European plan is much more supportive of Ukraine, recognising the enormous sacrifices it has made during its war with Russia. Among the key differences in the European plan is a requirement for “no restriction” to be placed on the size of the Ukrainian armed forces. Unlike the Trump plan, the European plan does not ban Ukraine from joining Nato, with the final decision subject to “consensus within the alliance”.</p>
<p>11-24 Reuters: U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency has disbanded with eight months left to its mandate, ending an initiative launched with fanfare as a symbol of Trump&rsquo;s pledge to slash the government&rsquo;s size but which critics say delivered few measurable savings. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month when asked about DOGE&rsquo;s status. It is no longer a &ldquo;centralized entity,&rdquo; Kupor added.</p>

President Trump said there were &ldquo;only a few remaining points of disagreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11-26 AP: Two West Virginia National Guard members who deployed to the nation’s capital were shot Wednesday just blocks from the White House in a brazen act of violence. The West Virginia governor initially said the troops had died, but later walked back the statement to say the office was “receiving conflicting reports about the condition.” The governor’s office did not immediately respond to questions about the attack and the condition of the troops. A suspect, now in custody, was also shot and has injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. One National Guard member was shot in the head, according to a person familiar with the details of the incident who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>11-28 Hegseth reported to have possibly committed a war crime. WaPo: The longer the U.S. surveillance aircraft followed the boat, the more confident intelligence analysts watching from command centers became that the 11 people on board were ferrying drugs. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken directive, according to two people with direct knowledge of the operation. “The order was to kill everybody,” one of them said. A missile screamed off the Trinidad coast, striking the vessel and igniting a blaze from bow to stern. For minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck. The Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions, two people familiar with the matter said. The two men were blown apart in the water.</p>
<p>11-28 WSJ: U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20 years old, one of the National Guard members targeted by a gunman in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, has died, according to President Trump. “She’s just passed away,” Trump said during a Thanksgiving call for servicemembers. “She’s no longer with us. She’s looking down at us right now. She was savagely attacked, she’s dead,” Trump said, adding the other victim is fighting for his life. Later in a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.”</p>
<p>11-28 Telegraph: The United States is poised to recognise Russia’s control over Crimea and other occupied Ukrainian territories to secure a deal to end the war. The Telegraph understands that Donald Trump has sent his peace envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner to make the direct offer to Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The plan to recognise territory, which breaks US diplomatic convention, is likely to go ahead despite concerns among Ukraine’s European allies. One well-placed source said: “It’s increasingly clear the Americans don’t care about the European position. They say the Europeans can do whatever they want.”</p>
<p>11-28 Mediaite: Trump took to Truth Social, where he railed against Somalis again and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (D), whom he called “seriously retarded” and claimed that the country’s foreign-born population is composed mostly of people who “are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.” The president also baselessly claimed that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), an immigrant who is one of a notable contingent of Somalis in Minnesota, “probably” entered the U.S. illegally and married her brother</p>

<p>11-29 Allen Analysis: “There is a new claim circulating about the D.C. National Guardsmen shooting, and it is gaining traction fast. According to posts now being shared across political X, the name of the alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, began spiking on Google Trends in Washington, D.C., hours before the attack took place. The claim suggests possible foreknowledge by unknown actors who searched his name long before the first shot was fired.”</p>

<p>12-02 Guardian: The Pentagon on Tuesday scapegoated a Navy admiral for the extrajudicial double-tap strike that killed survivors of a September attack on an alleged drug boat and vowed to continue operations, even as lawmakers investigate whether the attack constituted a war crime. At a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary said that the decision to restrike the narco terrorist vessel was made by Adm Frank M Bradley, “operating under clear and long standing authorities to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States was eliminated”. Wilson added that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon secretary, “stands behind Admiral Bradley, 100%”.</p>
<p>12-04 CNN: Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth risked compromising sensitive military information, which could have endangered American troops and mission objectives, when he used Signal in March of this year to share highly-sensitive attack plans targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to four sources familiar with the contents of a classified Inspector General report. The repercussions of Hegseth’s action, two sources told CNN, are less clear since the IG concluded that the defense secretary has the authority to declassify information and Hegseth asserted he made an operational decision in the moment to share that information, though there is no documentation of such a decision.</p>

<p>12-09 WaPo: A new U.S. national security strategy berating Europe has triggered a wave of acrimony across the Atlantic, enraging and dismaying European officials who say the document has turned the Trump administration’s vitriol against European democracies into formal policy. President Donald Trump’s push to halt the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia and the European Union’s announcement Friday of a roughly $140 million fine against X for violating the bloc’s digital rules have fueled the fire, pushing transatlantic relations to their lowest point since Trump returned to the White House in January.</p>

Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.”</p>

<p>12-16 White House chief of staff Susie Wiles is forcefully pushing back against a stunning, on-the-record Vanity Fair profile in which she is quoted making a series of sharply critical remarks about President Donald Trump as well as several top aides and Cabinet officials. The article, written by veteran Trump chronicler Chris Whipple, offers an extraordinary look at the first year of Trump’s second presidency, drawing on extensive and remarkably candid conversations with one of its chief architects. The resulting two-part profile sent shockwaves through the political media world. Among the most explosive revelations: a striking comparison between Trump and an “alcoholic”, a tacit acknowledgment that the Justice Department has been weaponized as part of a retribution campaign, a blunt characterization of Vice President JD Vance as a conspiracy theorist, and a pointed admission that Attorney General Pam Bondi “whiffed” on the Epstein files.</p>

<p>12-17 President Donald Trump will deliver a televised speech Wednesday evening that is expected to focus heavily on the economy, an effort to reverse declining public opinion numbers and the view even among some supporters that he has not lived up to key campaign promises. Trump’s ratings reached their lowest levels of his second term late last month. Although his numbers have rebounded slightly, he still remains underwater with the public, particularly on domestic economic issues such as the cost of living. Trump is not expected to make major new policy announcements during the 9 p.m. address, a White House official and a person close to the White House told The Washington Post. But the two individuals, who requested anonymity to preview the speech, cautioned that Trump could change his mind ahead of the address.</p>

<p>12-19 Politico: The Department of Justice released a portion of the vast trove of documents related to the federal government’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, after months of infighting that tested the unity of the MAGA movement. The release comes after Congress passed a bill ordering the Justice Department to make all of its unclassified records related to Epstein’s investigation and prosecution public by Dec. 19, despite initial objections from President Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that Friday’s release would not include all material and the department would disseminate potentially hundreds of thousands more files “over the next couple weeks.”&rdquo;</p>
<p>12-19 CNN: The US Department of Health and Human Services is planning to overhaul the schedule of recommended vaccines for children in the US, a person familiar with the plans told CNN on Thursday. The proposed new schedule would recommend fewer shots, bringing it closer in line with what’s recommended in other developed countries.
